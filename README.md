## Running the application

### Windows
The application was developed in Windows, and will by default have the tor-network expert bundle files in the application source directories. No more work is needed past downloading and running the application. 

### Mac OSx
In order for the application to work tor must be installed from either homebrew or Macports. There's no way for us to force an install therefore this will require manual work. More instructions can be found on the official Tor Project website: https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-osx.html.en

### Linux
Similar to Mac OSx tor needs to be installed from commandline, however it is less work. To install tor type `apt install tor` or `yum install tor`. Once tor installed no other work is needed, just download and run the application.
